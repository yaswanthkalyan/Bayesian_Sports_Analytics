# Bayesian Sports Analytics
## **📌 README: Developing Hierarchical Models for Sports Analytics**

### **🏆 Overview**
Sports analytics has evolved significantly, leveraging modern technologies such as **GPS tracking, high-speed cameras, and sensor-based data collection**. These tools generate **massive, high-resolution datasets** capturing player movement, game dynamics, and performance metrics at unprecedented detail.  

While **machine learning** is often the go-to approach for extracting insights, **Bayesian statistical methods** provide a **robust alternative** with unique advantages:  
✅ **Combining multiple data sources** seamlessly  
✅ **Imputing missing data naturally**  
✅ **Quantifying system uncertainties rigorously**  

This project explores the **development of hierarchical Bayesian models for sports analytics** using **PyMC version 5**, demonstrating a complete **Bayesian workflow**—from **data preparation** to **model estimation** and **prediction visualization**.  

### **🎯 Key Features**
🔹 **Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling**: Captures relationships across multiple levels of data (e.g., team-level, player-level)  
🔹 **Small Sample Adjustment**: Mitigates bias from limited player/game data  
🔹 **Uncertainty Estimation**: Generates **credible intervals** for predictions  
🔹 **Data Imputation**: Fills in missing values using Bayesian inference  
🔹 **PyMC v5 Implementation**: Leverages the latest advancements in Bayesian modeling

## **📊 Why Bayesian Methods for Sports Analytics?**
Bayesian models offer **several advantages** over traditional machine learning in sports analytics:  

| Feature | Bayesian Methods | Machine Learning |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Uncertainty Estimation** | ✅ Provides full posterior distributions | ❌ Often gives point estimates |
| **Small Sample Handling** | ✅ Hierarchical priors mitigate bias | ❌ Prone to overfitting with small data |
| **Interpretable Models** | ✅ Allows domain experts to set priors | ❌ Often black-box models |
| **Missing Data Handling** | ✅ Naturally imputes missing values | ❌ Requires imputation techniques |

Hierarchical Bayesian models extend these benefits by allowing information sharing **across multiple scales**, such as:  
✔ **Player-level performance within a team**  
✔ **Team-level performance across seasons**  
✔ **League-wide trends influencing teams**

## **🔧 Installation & Setup**
### **1️⃣ Install Dependencies**
Ensure you have Python **3.8+**, then install dependencies:  

install PyMC v5 manually:  
```bash
pip install pymc arviz numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn jupyterlab
```

### **2️⃣ Download Data**
Place raw sports data (e.g., baseball player statistics) in the `/data` directory.

### **3️⃣ Run Exploratory Analysis**
Launch Jupyter Notebook to explore the dataset and model the data:  
```bash
jupyter lab
```
Open `notebooks/exploratory_analysis.ipynb` to visualize key statistics.

### **4️⃣ Train Hierarchical Bayesian Model**
Run the Bayesian inference
This will:  
✅ **Load and preprocess data**  
✅ **Fit Bayesian hierarchical models**  
✅ **Generate posterior predictive samples**

## **📈 Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling Approach**
The model is structured as follows:

### **🔹 1. Data Levels**
- **Player-Level**: Individual performance stats
- **Team-Level**: Aggregated team performance
- **League-Level**: Overall league trends  

### **🔹 2. Priors and Distributions**
- **Player Performance** ∼ Normal(μ_team, σ_player)  
- **Team Performance** ∼ Normal(μ_league, σ_team)  
- **League Trends** ∼ Normal(μ_prior, σ_league)  

### **🔹 3. Bayesian Workflow**
✔ **Specify Priors** (expert-driven)  
✔ **Use MCMC Sampling (NUTS)** for posterior inference  
✔ **Generate Credible Intervals** (95% probability bounds)  

---

## **📊 Results & Visualization**
The model provides:
✔ **Posterior Distributions** of player/team abilities  
✔ **Credible Intervals** for performance predictions  
✔ **Ranking of Players & Teams** using Bayesian inference  

Example **posterior predictive check**:
```python
import arviz as az
az.plot_posterior(trace, var_names=["team_strength", "player_skill"])
```

Example **forest plot for uncertainty visualization**:
```python
az.plot_forest(trace, var_names=["team_strength", "player_skill"], combined=True)
```

## **🔍 Future Work**
✅ **Extend to Other Sports** (basketball, soccer)  
✅ **Incorporate More Data Sources** (tracking data, real-time sensor feeds)  
✅ **Apply Bayesian Decision Theory** for **game strategy optimization**
